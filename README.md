# Fun_Projects_with_Python 

## 1. Faulty Calculator:
### This project is based on the following scenario-
### In a school, one day a student was discussing with his friend that today is his exam of maths and he don't know how to calculate numbers so his friend gaved him a python program and said that this will help in calculating your problems. While they were discussing about cheating there teacher listened to their conversations and determined that today he will give his student a lesson that **study is very important**. So he smartly changed the python program and made some calculations faulty which was in the examination and rest of the calculations gives right answer.
